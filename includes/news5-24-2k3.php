<br>...<br><br>The music system will play background music for all the menu screens.  There will probably be a custom loop for the briefing and debriefing screens that is different from the "main theme" type music that will play during all the other menu screens.<br><br>Now that I re-read your message, I realize that you are talking about a voice-over audio file that reads the briefing text to the player.  I have no plans to support that, sorry.<br><br>However, you <i>can</i> attach a .wav file to any event that occurs during a mission.  So if you just trying to set the mood, you could create a mission event that occurs right at the start of the mission that reads a brief text passage to the player before the action heats up.<br><br>--milo<br><a href="http://www.starshatter.com" target="_mew" class="minilinks"><span class="forumlink">http://www.starshatter.com</span></a><br><br>
