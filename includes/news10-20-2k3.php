Campaign Three - Operation Shining Fortress is not finished or balanced. Don't bother reporting bugs that occur during that campaign.

If you do finish Campaign Three, you will see Campaign Four
in the menu. It doesn't exist, so don't try to play it. :-)<br>

<br>
KNOWN ISSUES:<br>

* STILL BROKE: auto nav skipping navpoints not in sector (actually, this could have been fixed when I reconnected the farcasters...I dunno, it needs testing)<br>
* CANT REPRO: bad graphics on SRM trail<br>
