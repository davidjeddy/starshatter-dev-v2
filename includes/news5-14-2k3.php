&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/14/2003 - 2:15pm EST - Hey there. Got a new website on the SSD network! Check out <a href="http://ssd.servehttp.com/CorEnt/" target="_new" class="minilinks">Starcraft to StarShatter (a Cor.Ent. production)</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also been slowly chissling away at the tutorials section. So hopefully in a month or two it'll be a comprehensive tutorial for everyone (hint hint- if anyone would like to contribute a tutorial please eMail me @ <a href="mailto:starshatterdev@hotmail.com" target="_new" class="minilinks">starshatterdev@hotmail.com</a> and let me know.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Side note: Wow, I missed the breaking 200 hits mark!)
