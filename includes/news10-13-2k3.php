&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/13/2003 - 12:05pm EST - Hello again! No Im not dead yet just college an work has been a real bi**h to me latly. I really neeed to setup a better college schedual for next semester.<br>
Anyways here's whats been goin on:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Babylon 5 demo has been released. Its for use on the Ss 3.8.x versions so if your not a beta tester you will <i> probly </i> run into some problems trying to play throught it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new version of shatner has also been released latly. This bug fix fix's some problems with that polygon shader routin in the converting of .MAG to .OBJ/.MTL.<br>
Starshatter Central has hit yet <b>another</b> road bump. Namlt still hosting problems...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of that milo is still plugging away and things are getting better and better.<br>
Have fun..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S.: I'll be adding the new shatner to SSDv2 soon. The B:5 mod is to large (I mean LARGE) and I cann't bear to watch my server come to a screaming hault again like it did whenx the Midnight on the Firing Line was released.
<br><br>
