&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/11/2003 - 2:00pm EST - so I got curieous and decided to check up on my server. Bandwidth, uptime and what not. Iabout fell out of my chair! As of right now SSDv2 itself has 3250 hits. what was also surprising was the other stats I pulled up:<br>
<TABLE cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" border="0" width="100%">
	<TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD colSpan=2>&nbsp;Bandwidth</TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD>&nbsp;Total Bandwidth&nbsp;</TD>
          <TD>&nbsp;51.92&nbsp;GB&nbsp;</TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD>&nbsp;Average Bandwidth per Day&nbsp;</TD>
          <TD>&nbsp;307.31&nbsp;MB&nbsp;</TD></TR>
        <TR1>
          <TD>&nbsp;Average Bandwidth per Hit&nbsp;</TD>
          <TD>&nbsp;102.35&nbsp;KB&nbsp;</TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD>&nbsp;Average Bandwidth per Visitor&nbsp;</TD>
          <TD>&nbsp;1.52&nbsp;MB&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><br>
